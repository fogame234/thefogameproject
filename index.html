                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>With a deep passion for cybersecurity, I specialize in both Threat Intelligence and Network Security. My expertise lies in identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing cyber threats, and implementing robust security measures to protect digital infrastructures. I am dedicated to advancing the safety and resilience of the digital world, constantly evolving with the ever-changing landscape of cyber threats.
                        <br><br>

                        My journey in cybersecurity is built on a strong foundation of knowledge and hands-on experience. I am committed to continuously learning, adapting, and staying ahead of emerging challenges in the field. As a cybersecurity professional, I combine technical expertise with strategic insight to drive impactful security solutions..</p>
                    
                        <h3>Programming Proficiency</h3>
                        <p>Programming is not just a skill; it's a passion for me. I'm proficient in several programming languages, including Python and Bash. Whether it's automating tasks, building applications, or creating scripts to simplify complex processes, coding is where I find my creative outlet and problem-solving joy.
                        <br><br>

                        In addition to my programming experience, I specialize in building OSINT reconnaissance tools for platforms like IRC, Telegram, and Discord channels. By leveraging custom scripts and data collection techniques, I uncover valuable insights and monitor potential threats across these communication channels.</p>

                        <h3>Pentesting Specialist</h3>
                        <p>Penetration testing, or pentesting, is where I combine my cybersecurity knowledge and programming skills to simulate cyberattacks and discover vulnerabilities in systems and networks. I thrive on the challenge of uncovering security weaknesses and helping organizations strengthen their digital defenses.
                        <br><br>

                        In addition to technical testing, I specialize in social engineering, utilizing psychological tactics to identify human vulnerabilities and assess the overall security posture of an organization. Itâ€™s all about finding the most effective ways to defend against both technical and human-based threats.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Threat actor profiling</h3>
                        <p>Threat actor profiling is a crucial aspect of my approach to cybersecurity. By leveraging OSINT, I analyze the patterns, behaviors, and tactics of potential threat actors to gain a deeper understanding of their motivations and methods. This process allows me to develop detailed profiles, track emerging threats, and predict attack strategies.</p>
