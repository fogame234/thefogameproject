                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>With a deep passion for cybersecurity, I specialize in both Threat Intelligence and Network Security. My expertise lies in identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing cyber threats, and implementing robust security measures to protect digital infrastructures. I am dedicated to advancing the safety and resilience of the digital world, constantly evolving with the ever-changing landscape of cyber threats.

                        My journey in cybersecurity is built on a strong foundation of knowledge and hands-on experience. I am committed to continuously learning, adapting, and staying ahead of emerging challenges in the field. As a cybersecurity professional, I combine technical expertise with strategic insight to drive impactful security solutions..</p>
                    
                        <h3>Programming Proficiency</h3>
                        <p>Programming is not just a skill; it's a passion for me. I'm proficient in several programming languages, including Python and Bash. Whether it's automating tasks, building applications, or creating scripts to simplify complex processes, coding is where I find my creative outlet and problem-solving joy.

                        In addition to my programming experience, I specialize in building OSINT reconnaissance tools for platforms like IRC, Telegram, and Discord channels. By leveraging custom scripts and data collection techniques, I uncover valuable insights and monitor potential threats across these communication channels.</p>

                        <h3>Pentesting Specialist</h3>
                        <p>Penetration testing, or pentesting, is where I combine my cybersecurity knowledge and programming skills to simulate cyberattacks and discover vulnerabilities in systems and networks. I thrive on the challenge of uncovering security weaknesses and helping organizations strengthen their digital defenses.

                        In addition to technical testing, I specialize in social engineering, utilizing psychological tactics to identify human vulnerabilities and assess the overall security posture of an organization. Itâ€™s all about finding the most effective ways to defend against both technical and human-based threats.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Threat actor profiling</h3>
                        <p>Threat actor profiling is a crucial aspect of my approach to cybersecurity. By leveraging OSINT, I analyze the patterns, behaviors, and tactics of potential threat actors to gain a deeper understanding of their motivations and methods. This process allows me to develop detailed profiles, track emerging threats, and predict attack strategies.</p>

                <p>OSINT Reconnaissance Tools

                    I am currently developing advanced OSINT reconnaissance tools for communication platforms like IRC, Telegram, and Discord, leveraging Python to automate data collection and analysis. In addition to monitoring these platforms, I am also scraping known forums for valuable threat intelligence. By aggregating and analyzing this data, I am able to build detailed threat actor profiles, track emerging threats, and identify potential vulnerabilities. This proactive approach enables me to detect early indicators of malicious activity and provide actionable defense solutions for enhanced cybersecurity.

            <H3>Threat Actor Profiling</H3>
                <p>
                    Another ongoing project involves threat actor profiling, which directly ties into my OSINT reconnaissance tools. I am leveraging OSINT to analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of cyber adversaries by scraping known forums and communication platforms like IRC, Telegram, and Discord. Using the data gathered from these sources, I develop detailed threat actor profiles, which help predict attack strategies and identify potential threats. This proactive approach enables me to stay ahead of emerging threat trends and provide actionable insights, strengthening overall cybersecurity defenses.
